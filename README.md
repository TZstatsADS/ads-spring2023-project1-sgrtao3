Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: History of Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Ranran Tao

+ Project summary: Philosophy is a diverse and rich field that has thousands of years of history with a wide range of ideas and thoughts. From ancient Greeks to the modern day, it produces critical thinkers, communicators, as well as theories and arguments that have shaped our understanding of the world. This analysis aims to offer all levels of audience a unique perspective on the history of philosophy, using data mining, statistical analysis and visualization on [the philosophy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy?resource=download&select=philosophy_data.csv). The dataset has over 300,000 sentences said by philosophers from 13 schools of philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism, Rationalism, Empiricism, German Idealism, Nietzsche, Communism, Capitalism, Phenomenology, Continental, Analytic, and Feminism. We will firstly look at the main philosophy topics, discuss the sentiment of these philosophy texts, examine the sizes of the text content in each school, and finally see how the philosophy has developed over thousand of years.
